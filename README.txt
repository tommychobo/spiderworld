This is the integrated spider world demo for assignment 1!
For this assignment, we integrated 4 separate components:
- A basic gui with buttons and sliders
- A workspace in which simple shapes can be dragged and dropped to new positions
- A side panel in which the desired shape can be selected
- A grid that displays simple shapes and will eventually turn into the grid that the spider moves around on

Right now, there is limited functionality in the integrated spider world demo.
However, the gray square in the Shape Panel can be clicked to generate a randomly colored shape in the workspace.
This workspace shape can be moved around. Also, the slider moves and buttons can be pressed.
